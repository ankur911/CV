## EXPERIENCE

### Data Science Lead | Liberty Global | Amsterdam, Netherlands | July 2022 - Present
- Designed and deployed a production-grade RAG system on BigQuery integrated with Large language models (LLMs) to automate ticket prioritization from large volumes of unstructured support data, improving operational efficiency and response speed by 80%.
- Built real-time anomaly detection models for location-level operational errors (buffering, WiFi, app failures), enabling 15-min alerts that accelerated network issue resolution and improved customer satisfaction.
- Developed root-cause models to diagnose customer-level buffering errors, pinpointing whether issues stemmed from network, pod, cable, or modem, enabling targeted field interventions.
- Delivered actionable dashboards in Looker and collaborated with cross-functional teams to integrate AI models into operational workflows.

### Data Scientist | Lowell | Amsterdam, Netherlands | April 2019 - June 2022
- Developed machine learning models for pricing portfolios in debt collection, enhancing revenue forecasting accuracy within 5% error to actual.

### Computational Biophysics Researcher - PHD | University of Groningen | Groningen, Netherlands | March 2014 - March 2019
- Designed and executed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of nuclear pore complexes (~100K particles, 200M time steps at 20 fs per step) on HPC clusters, iterating across multiple NPC strains to model nanoscale transport mechanisms.
- Engineered automated workflows for large-scale trajectory analysis, producing density maps, autocorrelation functions, and energy barriers (from umbrella sampling) — analogous to feature engineering, probabilistic modelling and bias-reduction techniques in AI.
- Applied statistical modelling and pattern recognition to uncover molecular drivers of transport selectivity; published 7 peer reviewed papers in Nature Communications, eLife, PNAS, Biophysical Journal etc.
